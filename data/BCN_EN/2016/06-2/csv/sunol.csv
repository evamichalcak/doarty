These works have similar characteristics, and invite us to come up with a response to them so as to complete their communicative process. This document presents an itinerary or route to help visitors look, think, analyze, question, feel, work through and enjoy the various pieces shown in the exhibition. Along with this itinerary, you will find two more, each opening up possibilities for other readings and a variety of visit experiences. Feel free to do all three, or none at all. You can follow these itineraries on your own or as part of a group. Furthermore, we invite you to get to know all the pieces shown in the exhibition in an active way.</p><p><a href='http://www.fundaciosunol.org/en/event/recorreguts-dialegs-de-la-mirada/?instance_id=2057' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>",04/12/2016,,"Exhibition, Fundación Suñol, AContemporary art",Fundación Suñol,Fundación Suñol,4,1,1,1,,
