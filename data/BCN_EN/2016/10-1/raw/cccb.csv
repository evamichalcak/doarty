After the End of the World,http://www.cccb.org/en/exhibitions/file/after-the-end-of-the-world/224747,After the End of the World,,"“After the End of the World” is an exhibition about the planet of 2017, irreversibly transformed into an Anthropocene planet after two centuries of human intervention in natural systems. But it is also an exhibition about how we will reach the world of the latter half of the 21st century, and about our society’s responsibility to the generations who will be born and grow up in it. The show will take place between October 2017 and April 2018 (dates to be determined).",null,null,null,null,null,http://www.cccb.org/en/exhibitions/file/after-the-end-of-the-world/224747,,25 October 2017 - 1 April 2018,25 October 2017 - 1 April 2018
