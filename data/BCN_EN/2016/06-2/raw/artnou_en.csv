Max Gartner believes that the creative energy that its applied to express ourselves as individuals, in fact, does not come from us, but we are “only” leaders of it.
“The way I express it is mostly visual. I am not particularly in favor of explaining my work because I believe that the energy invested in an artwork makes that it has its own life and that is speaks for itself. The interpretation, or just the feeling it may cause to me can be very different from the spectator, although both interpretations are part of the same reality”
Some of the artworks created for the exhibitions have been produced using the technique of carving wood, which Balinese people produce figures for their religious ceremonies. The combination between the drawing of Max Gärtner and the traditional craft discipline of the “Island of Gods” it is also a “mixture” of visual expressions of two different cultures, and an assessment of the importance of spirituality on art.
The Spanish-Germany artist likes to dramatize his exhibitions in the style of a “modern temple” with the idea of creating a space that seeks to relate human existence and its connection with the divine, through artistic expression.","null","null","null","http://www.artbarcelona.es/artnou/en/expositions/lords-of-gods/"

The series reflects situations of absolute intimacy and solitude where the subject is totally isolated from all surroundings and is immersed in the light emitted by certain electronic devices.
Light takes on a spiritual connotation. If someone unaware of the meaning of the screen itself were to observe the scenes that make up Phosphorescence, they would think something magical or mystical was happening.
Silence, stillness, calm. The invasion of the intimate space.
The characters appear from the shadows and are immersed in this light that traps them. The subtlety of the darkness makes their faces appear blurred, and lose their identity, in a metaphor for depersonalisation.

In Saló’s paintings, the abstract is reconciled with the decorative, meditation with spirituality. The canvas designs a network of meanings produced from primary forms that are repeated without beginning or end.

(...) However, then returns as a ghost to disrupt the calm of a later present"".
Nietzsche, Friedrich. Segunda Intempestiva
""Enésima Intempestiva"" draws attention to nietzschean philosophy in order to claim the necessity to return to a slow time. In opposite to his proposal to learn to look back in order to go forward, we are living in an homogeneous succession of presents which run aimless and out of control. That is why we find in the untimely -not occurring at a suitable time or season- how to decelerate the frenzy rhythm in which we are immersed.
To recover a tranquil pace is the only way to regain a full life we want to repeat uncountable times. Thus, both critic and bellicose attitude that runs through ""Untiemely Meditations"" (in Spanish ""Consideraciones Intempestivas"") and the idea of ​​eternal return, underlies us the theoretical framework of the exhibition.

How to represent an idea is an exhibition that shows drawings and photographs that are part of a multidisciplinary art project, a field work about the Llobregat river. These works are based on the images we have learned to represent what we know as a river, the idea of a river. And they suggest a willingness to rethink the conventional way of representing the natural flow of water that goes into the sea, a lake or another river, without resorting to conventional drawing strategies, while also highlighting the boundaries of visual language with which the artist encounters when she or he wants to represent reality.

""Despite the universal nature of visual language, the image is a cultural product, which makes its meaning could change considerably depending on who reads the image. Inevitably I belong to a particular context in which I learned to read the visual language and the images representing what is around to me. As a spectator, I interpret and I understand a meaning, while I wonder if this should be the only one to be attributed to that image. In my artwork, I try to understand the visual signs that we have learned to represent the reality we know, how we interpreted them and how new ones are generated.

What Berliners don’t need anymore, they don’t throw away, but leave it in the streets. Whatever one finds in the streets, can be taken home. It is a strange unspoken agreement, everybody knows it, most accept it and many take part in this social practice.
There is no exchange transaction between giver and taker. It is a transfer that works in two independent actions: the object is placed in the street, often with a little note that says “zu verschenken” (to give), whoever passing by recognizes it as a finding, takes it home.
The status of these objects is some kind of limbo: between ownerships, potentially useful but decaying outdoors, displayed for an unconditional appropriation, but illegal.
As if they were price tags they have little notes attached to them, instead, this is not what they are. They say “To give”, “To take away”, “Clean and disinfected”, “Dear neighbor, it is clear that no one is interested in this stuff, it would be good if you could take care of them yourself. Thank you!”  In contrast to price tags, they are not the names for the abstract phenomena of economic value, but they evaluate the use value in a communicative exchange between giver and taker.
The city becomes a depot - storage of free objects that appear, disappear, and eventually reappear in a constantly changing constellation. The impossible collection of these temporary available elements constitutes an infinite inventory and a new mapping of the city, that can only be grasped by fragments and never completed.","null","null","null","http://www.artbarcelona.es/artnou/en/expositions/zu-verschenken/"

German photography has led the world into a new understanding of our relationship to the urban and man-made environment. It revealed how photographs of architecture are important, not only as art, but also as a testimony of time, trends and evolution, as documentary of buildings that have since been destroyed. Matthias Heiderich’s photos are not the exceptions to the rule. The influence of the German tradition is omnipresent in his work. With the same rigor and pragmatism as the Bechers, Heiderich also creates typologies of industrial buildings and structures.

With the help of an anthropologist, a lawyer, psychoanalyst, stylist, decorator and writer, Alex has been imagined and followed for more than a year in the process of integration in real life, faced with the construction of its social, administrative and emotional existence.

The exhibition design allows visitors to slip inside the character's life: benches and cushions with printed objects, standard furniture and personal effects of Alex, the display evokes a domestic interior and allows to discover 6 videos of Alex's life, from its genesis to its ""first steps"".

A casting to choose the right Alex, the meetings of professionals, the moments of the construction of a character without a past...

With this Project, Pauline Bastard raises a number of questions.

How to manipulate the creative form? How to manipulate the natural and the supernatural without falling into chaos?

Alex talks about the construction of identity, of our society. Who is Alex?","null","null","null","http://www.artbarcelona.es/artnou/en/expositions/alex/"

tiempo. La ciudad de Barcelona en este trabajo no se considera como el hormigón y el espacio real, sino

como una película fotosensible en la que están todos marcados por las pistas, medida con la noción de

tiempo y no con las distancias. El principal trabajo será un resumen mapa de la ciudad que va a ocupar la

pared, en la azotea y el piso sobre el que se dibujan con alambres de diferentes viajes del protagonista, la

adición de acuarelas y las instantáneas y otros artículos importantes durante el viaje. Durante su estancia, el

artista siempre se da cuenta esta noción de imagen de la ciudad, obras trans-disciplinaria, siempre basadas en

la noción de tiempo, colocan la idea de la imagen o el consumo","null","null","null","http://www.artbarcelona.es/artnou/en/expositions/spending-time-in-barcelona/"
