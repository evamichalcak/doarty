,http://artssantamonica.gencat.cat/en/detall/60dB-16kHz,"60 dB / 16 kHz. BCN. Can you hear the violence? is a collective documentary exhibition that aims to reflect on certain forms of non-explicit violence that take place in a city like Barcelona. The materials in the exhibition are the result of varied artistic and anthropological research, as well as the experiences of different activist organizations.
The elements in the exhibition all have in common that they point out forms of forceful imposition that tend to go unnoticed as violence because they are diluted into our everyday lives, and they end up being mixed into what we call “normalcy”.
The guiding theme that ties the different parts of the exhibit together is acoustic: a constant, nearly inaudible, drone that accompanies the visitors through the exhibition. As people move through the space, they are invited to stop and listen to the sounds they hear regularly on any given day, and they are made to realize the extent to which those sounds are indicators forms of violence. At the end of the exhibition, the ambient noise becomes a din: characteristic of a society where violence is normal.
60 dB / 16 kHz. 60 decibels is the level of sound that corresponds to the usual agglomeration of people on the street: the noise of the city. 16 kilohertz corresponds to a high-pitched, inaudible frequency. The subtitle of the exhibition in Catalan – Sents la violència? – plays with the different meanings of the verb “sentir”: “to hear” and, also, “to feel” or “perceive”.  
This expresses the central idea of the exhibition: violence isn’t an exception or an accident; on the contrary, it is a sort of continuous sound atmosphere, which we don’t hear because we are inside it.
In parallel to the exhibition, a series of lectures and documentary films will be offered, to be held in the Arts Santa Mònica lecture room on Wednesday October 19 and 26, Thursday October 3 and 10, Thursday November 24, and Tuesday December 22.
There are a lot of forms of violence that go unnoticed. The fact that you can’t hear them doesn’t mean they don’t exist.

,http://artssantamonica.gencat.cat/en/detall/Tecnologies-de-la-violencia,"TECHNOLOGIES OF VIOLENCE explores the critical relations between art and the contemporary production of violence and the digital technologies, as well as the techniques that power uses to impose itself through violence.
Technology, as a system used to organise, service and control power, finds, in its machines, in Internet and electronic systems, tools for world dominance that, after World War Two and during the Cold War, led to the emergence of a “new era in political security”, according to Ralf Fücks, director of Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung, in a publication entitled Hich-Tech-Kriege (High-Tech Wars).
Control of the air and cyberspace and “control of terror”, identified by theorists like Peter Sloterdijk, Marc Augé, Jutta Weber, Herfried Münkler, Constanze Kurz and Paul Virilio, is the goal of the great powers, including governments, companies and terrorist groups, which use sophisticated technology to establish their war zones, generate chaos and seize local and global dominance: anonymous, remote controlled killing by electronic operations; advanced development of cameras, drones and sensors; autonomous computer combat systems; satellite surveillance; and preventive security policies, police control, the killing and forced displacement of people.
TECHNOLOGIES OF VIOLENCE meditates on the shape that violence takes in the collective imagination, on the iconography and symbology of the media and entertainment industry, and the different ways in which the war industry produces, consumes and uses images (cartoons, video games, software and so on). Moreover, taking up the ideas of Foucault, Achille Mbembe and Subhabrata Banerjee about biopolitics, “necropolitics” and “necrocapitalism” as a global system of death production, the exhibition also looks at the forms of insubordination that artists have worked on since the 2000s, as well as the so-called GWOT (Global War on Terrorism) and the implosion of the neocapitalist system after the failure of the great systems of ideological “redemption”.",null,Technologies of violence,18.10.2016 - 08.01.2017,18.10.2016 - 08.01.2017,http://artssantamonica.gencat.cat/web/.content/Imatge/exposicio/2016/Tecnologies-de-la-violencia/image7-606x420.jpg_356955165.jpg,null,null,null,null,/en/detall/Tecnologies-de-la-violencia,null
