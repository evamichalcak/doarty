With a very artistic and poetic touch, they use big data to build engaging and thought-provoking installations.\nCICLO.IO is a collective of artists&makers set up in Valencia, Madrid and Barcelona. Using Arduino and JavaScript, they also give life to crazy interactive installations.\n\nOn March 12th 2016, Domestic Data Streamers and ciclo.io stayed at MOB&PAU for the night and gave birth to what we now call “The wall”. This installation is a giant voting system. It questions the consideration of every individual in decision taking and the possibility of radical democracy, thanks to the access of all to the internet and the creation of big datas.\n\nEvery week, a new question is hanged up on the wall and asked to the MOB assembly. Through social media or physically pressing a button on the wall, everyone can vote and suggest the question of the next week. For a drastical transparency, the results of the previous weeks are also displayed.\n\n On May 25th at MOB&PAU from 7:30pm, inaugurate this great installation and bring your a question that needs a council of elders to be answered. This project being a good reflection of the Civic Tech movement, Paul-Marie Carfantan launcher of Civic Tech Barcelona will take the opportunity to introduce you to the thematic of how new technologies can influence our democracies?","event_cost__0":"","event_category__Exposición__Espacios alternativos":"","event_start-time":"19:30","event_end-time":"22:00","event_id":"1638670899790963"}]
