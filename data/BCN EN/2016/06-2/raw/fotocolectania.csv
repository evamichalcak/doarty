"Vivian Maier. In Her Own Hands","http://www.colectania.es/img_exp/vivianmaiericonowebfoto23051082.jpg","This exhibition brings together more than 80 photographs, most of them unpublished, of this American photographer who has managed to captivate the world after the chance discovery of her files, shortly before her death. In 2007, a young researcher in the history of Chicago, John Maloof, bought at a small neighbourhood auction some abandoned belongings of a totally unknown elderly woman named Vivian Maier. What no one could imagine was that her wardrobe harboured a huge photographic work: more than 120,000 negatives, home movies and sound recordings that would change the history of photography.","From june 6 to september 10 of 2016","From june 6 to september 10 of 2016","null","null","null","null","null","Vivian Maier.
