    "event_text": "The show, which will be open at the Museu del Disseny from 16 September 2016 to 29 January 2017, features a selection of three hundred ceramic pieces applied in architecture, from Antiquity to the present. The works are from both the Museum’s own collections and from numerous European museums.\nBrick by Brick: Ceramics Applied to Architecture is the first exhibition devoted to the uses, functions, symbolism and aesthetics of this type of ceramic, with works from the ancient world to the present, particularly from the Mediterranean area, including the Middle East.\nThe show will include some three hundred pieces from forty European centres, both public and private, ranging from works from Ancient Mesopotamia to innovative modern-day projects.\nIn this exhibition, the Museu del Disseny aims to highlight the importance and the continuing use of ceramic in architecture, as well as focusing on both long-standing traditions and innovation in this field over the course of the millennia.\nCurated by the architect Pedro Azara, the show will open simultaneously with the Forty-Seventh Congress of the International Academy of Ceramics in Barcelona, an event that will be hosted in the Disseny Hub Barcelona building, which also houses the Museum itself.\nParallel to the exhibition, moreover, the Museum will stage a programme of activities organised in cooperation with the Ceramics Chair of the International University of Catalonia.\nOPENING: 15 September 2016",
