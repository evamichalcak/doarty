Walter Benjamin Make site offers an essay on the idea latent in the walls squatted building in which it is located, establishing certain metalanguages ​​between space and proposals. </font><font>The room itself usurped serves as a </font><font>starting point to develop a reflection around the exercise of self - </font><font>management of everyday life. </font><font>The exhibition articulates a knot of signifiers, an intimate relationship between container and content, signaling the symbiosis between strategies that seek a tough life to the prevailing logic and divergent tactics of artistic languages. </font><font>Hypocritically self - </font><font>management is rewarded, the reward hypocritically resistance. </font><font>Talk to inhabit the margins not far from certain practices within the context of contemporary art, but it </font><font>is not the same as </font><font>believing in a showcase architecture that believe in an architecture of affection. </font><font>And activate the space means activate the space, with everything that entails, and nothing else. </font><font>Make this site is, and has to do with the place but also over time, because doing site has to be a constant so that nothing remains empty and nothing is durable. </font><font>Speaking of the exhibition hall as a space of resistance is not always a metaphor. </font><font>Efren Alvarez Mata Barcelona · · · Berta Lucia Pino C.
