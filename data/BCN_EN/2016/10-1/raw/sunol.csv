Once a month, we propose a reading that is linked to the artistic field because of its content or context. The titles have been selected taking the current exhibition and the collection into account. With regard to the readings proposed, we will celebrate a colloquium at the foundation with the participation of artists, writers and curators. Each session will be centered in two different readings. The main one should be read by all the participants, and the secondary one –aimed at those who read a lot– can be used as complementary.","24.10. - 19.12.2016","24.10. - 19.12.2016","null","null","null","null","null","LITERARTURA at Fundació Suñol"
