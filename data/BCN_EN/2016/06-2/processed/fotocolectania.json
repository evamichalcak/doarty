In 2007, a young researcher in the history of Chicago, John Maloof, bought at a small neighbourhood auction some abandoned belongings of a totally unknown elderly woman named Vivian Maier. What no one could imagine was that her wardrobe harboured a huge photographic work: more than 120,000 negatives, home movies and sound recordings that would change the history of photography.</p><p><a href='http://www.colectania.es/index.php?i=1&p=2' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>","event_start":"06/01/2006","event_end":"","event_category":"Exhibition, Fundació Foto Colectania, Photography","event_organizer":"Fundació Foto Colectania","event_venue":"Fundació Foto Colectania","event_cost":"3","event_map":1,"event_maplink":1,"event_allday":1,"event_start-time":"","event_end-time":""}]
