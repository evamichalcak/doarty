"Laudem vitae (1943-2009)","Thursday 05 | May  | 2016 - Sunday 26 | June  | 2016","“Bartolozzi. Laudem vitae (1943-2009)” celebrates the fullness of life in the shape of a display of 40 pieces from the private collection of Rafael Bartolozzi (Pamplona, 1943-Tarragona, 2009), bringing together the main motifs from a body of work that explores the possibilities of New Figuration from an erotic, playful and poetic point of view. A leading light of Pop Art in Spain, Bartolozzi’s is a sensitively expressive body of work that draws on memories, dreams, nostalgia, and being in nature.","https://gestio.fundaciovilacasas.com/contactes//upfiles/exposicions/imatges/th_th_A9910090.jpg","Thursday 05 | May  | 2016 - Sunday 26 | June  | 2016","","null","null","null","null","en/exhibition/laudem-vitae-1943-2009","Rafael Bartolozzi","","http://www.fundaciovilacasas.com/en/exhibition/laudem-vitae-1943-2009"

"L’escala de l’enteniment. Ramon Llull, 1316-2016","Thursday 05 | May  | 2016 - Sunday 17 | July  | 2016","“L’escala de l’enteniment. Ramon Llull, 1316-2016” (The Stairway of Understanding. Ramon Llull, 1316-2016), is an outcome of the intersection between art, philosophy and mathematics.  The painter and sculptor Alfonzo Alzamora (Barcelona, 1951), producer of an output of minimalistic poesy, translates into visual language Llull’s symbols of the stairway of understanding and the tree of science in a work that is based on an aesthetic study of iconography and an investigation into the grammar of volume, equilibrium and symmetry. The project, co-curated by, Glòria Bosch, director of art at the Fundació Vila Casas; Amador Vega, chair of Aesthetics and Theory of Art at Universidad Pompeu Fabra and expert on Ramon Llull; and Pelegrí Viader, mathematician and lecturer at Universidad Pompeu Fabra, got underway on 3 March with the siting of a sculpture at the Ciutadella campus of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra. In conjunction, the Espai Volart will host a talk by Amador Vega entitled “The Stairway of Understanding: Aesthetic Approaches to Llull’s Logic” on 11 May at 7 pm.","https://gestio.fundaciovilacasas.com/contactes//upfiles/exposicions/imatges/th_th_A10775340.jpg","Thursday 05 | May  | 2016 - Sunday 17 | July  | 2016","","null","null","null","null","en/exhibition/lescala-de-lenteniment-ramon-llull-1316-2016","Alfonso Alzamora","","http://www.fundaciovilacasas.com/en/exhibition/lescala-de-lenteniment-ramon-llull-1316-2016"
"Open the windows. From Rogent to Roca-Sastre","Thursday 15 | September  | 2016 - Sunday 18 | December  | 2016","In 1980 Josep Roca-Sastre (Terrassa, 1928-Barcelona, 1997) dedicated his speech of acceptance into the Academia de Bellas Artes de Sant Jordi to Ramon Rogent (Barcelona, 1920-Plan d’Orgon, France, 1958). Roca-Sastre, forged, according to Francesc Fontbona, in the “wake of Cubism and the schematic realism popular in Paris at the time”, found in Rogent – reviver of Catalan art of the 1940’s – a suitable guide for his artistic activity.  From Rogent to Roca-Sastre traces an area of creative confluence between two artists who shared physical space – Rogent’s studio – geometric, rhythmic and compositional affinities, as well as a revitalising and integrating vision of the arts.","https://gestio.fundaciovilacasas.com/contactes//upfiles/exposicions/imatges/th_th_A9805163.jpg","Thursday 15 | September  | 2016 - Sunday 18 | December  | 2016","","null","null","null","null","en/exhibition/open-the-windows-from-rogent-to-roca-sastre","","","http://www.fundaciovilacasas.com/en/exhibition/open-the-windows-from-rogent-to-roca-sastre"
