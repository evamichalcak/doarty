The mouth is often used to tear, push, move and/or demolish daily objects and architectural surroundings. Distanced from its contemporary civilized usages. A practice that embraces the visceral wherein destruction is a form of creation. For her project with Counter Space, Rochat turns to the political. She questions conditions of contemporary Switzerland; bunkers for all, the world’s biggest tax haven, and a nation performing very well in many measures of well-being. A place faraway from many harsh realities of the world.\n\nHer desire to work on “radical” projects is stronger than ever.","event_cost__0":"","event_category__Exposición__Espacios alternativos":"","event_start-time":"14:00","event_end-time":"15:30","event_id":"708954719266007"}]
