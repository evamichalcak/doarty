				 - Brut Nature' />Solo exhibition by the winner of the 2015 Fundació Vila Casas Sculpture Prize. Solo exhibition by the winner of Fundació Vila Casas Sculpture Prize in 2015. Gerard Mas (Sant Feliu de Guíxols, 1976), who trained as a sculptor and stone cutter, works with paradox, contradiction, decontextualisation and irony to create dialogue between classical intent and contemporary impulse. As the critic Conxita Oliver put it, “Mas is interested in the image from the point of view of visualisation, empty of historical significance, perhaps as a paradigm of today's knowledge in which image replaces content.”</p><p><a href='http://www.fundaciovilacasas.com/en/exhibition/brut-nature' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>",09/19/2016,12/18/2016,"Exhibition, Museo Can Framis, Painting, Local art",Museo Can Framis,Museo Can Framis,5,1,1,1,,

				 - Painting' />“Ràfols-Casamada presents,” wrote the historian and critic J.F. Yvars, “in sharp profile the Romantic chimera we still refer to as the complete artist.” Merging Catalan classical tradition with his own sensibility and producing art that is spontaneous and expresses the subconscious, Ràfols-Casamada (Barcelona, 1923-2009) is a key figure in the history of Catalan art who has bequeathed us a recognition of painterly painting; the material of painting as an artistic object in itself.  Pintura (Painting) brings together, alongside passages from his personal journal, around 40 works in which the artist discourses with reality via the silences of form and colour.</p><p><a href='http://www.fundaciovilacasas.com/en/exhibition/painting' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>",04/18/2016,07/17/2016,"Exhibition, Museo Can Framis, Painting, Local art",Museo Can Framis,Museo Can Framis,5,1,1,1,,
