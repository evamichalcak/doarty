				 - JORDI ALCARAZ' />Jordi Alcaraz (Calella, 1963) is a creator at the intersection between visual poetry and conceptual projection, whose work consists of a metaphorical approach to the object. Alcaraz experiments with fragile materials imbued with a certain lyricism – water, glass, mirrors and books – to create bonds of tension between them, while constructing a discourse associated with volume, language and time. His output, which transcends limits between disciplines, is a paean to the unfinished work and art as fiction.</p><p><a href='http://www.fundaciovilacasas.com/en/exhibition/jordi-alcaraz' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>",01/23/2016,06/18/2016,"Exhibition, Museo Can Framis, Painting, Local art",Museo Can Framis,Museo Can Framis,5,1,1,1,,
