The show, produced by the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, has already been seen by more than a million visitors in such cities as the British capital, Berlin, Paris and Chicago. Currently open at the Museo d’Arte Moderna di Bologna (MAMbo), the retrospective will travel to Tokyo before coming to Barcelona, its last European venue.
As the depository of a huge collection of objects outstanding for their creativity and innovation, it is only natural that Barcelona  Museu del Disseny (Barcelona Design Museum) should host this unique retrospective devoted to the life and work of David Bowie. The British artist’s multidisciplinary talent and ceaseless search for innovation is echoed in the Museum’s commitment to exploring and demonstrating the connections between art and design, particularly in the field of graphic design and fashion.
David Bowie is can well be considered the definitive retrospective of the British artist, and Bowie himself was personally involved in its organisation. The show features more than 300 objects, including handwritten lyrics, original costumes, fashion, photography, film, music videos, set designs and Bowie's own instruments.",25 / 05 / 2017,null,null,null,null,null,null,"David Bowie Is
