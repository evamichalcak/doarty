The materials thus function directly as a discourse rather than a means, asserting the mechanisms that render them invisible and neutral within the flexible forms of art. In short, Background Immunity explores how the notion of progress affects the way in which the forms of artistic representation as well as the relationships of technical dependence between scientific development and artistic discourses responsive to the social evolution of technology are established.","null","null","","null","null","/en/exposicions/background-immunity"

Un espectacle visual a l’estil copla-terror on topen dues mitologies, la del cabaret barcelonès i la grega clàssica. Una invocació als déus del subsòl seguint la tradició del ritus dels Cabirs, en què el foc, la sang i la ridiculització dels atributs masculins són els ingredients essencials que permeten conèixer una història local i, alhora, universal.","null","null","","null","null","/en/exposicions/el-misterio-de-caviria"

The next day he delivered a 21-hour faux filibuster, which is the practice of giving a prolonged speech with the aim of paralysing parliamentary debate and blocking the approval of a law.","null","null","","null","null","/en/exposicions/until-i-am-no-longer-able-stand"

Marcos Mota)","Within his prolific literary output, in 1976 Alberto Cardín wrote a film script that remains unpublished, titled No es homosexual simplemente el homófilo, sino el cegado por el falo perdido, today part of the Biblioteca Alberto Cardín. The script was developed in the context of Spain during the first project for a political reform bill and the first democratic election of a president following the Franco dictatorship. Its activation and realization -for the first time- in the present again impacts national macropolitics right at a time of paradigm shift, or what is being called the ‘Second Transition’.","null","null","","null","null","/en/exposicions/no-es-homosexual-simplemente-el-hom%C3%B3filo-sino-el-cegado-por-el-falo-perdido"

During this time I have been flooded with a series of thoughts and reflections on what such a radical change in lifestyle entails: going from living in a city like Barcelona to being isolated in a house a half hour’s drive away from the nearest town. Some factors that have changed in my life are the passage of time and time management and how it seems like the forest envelops everything in a comfortable languor. There are many more, like leaving behind consumerism, noise and the bustle of civilization, and others of a political nature, such as whether isolating oneself corresponds to a desire for civil disobedience.","null","null","","null","null","/en/exposicions/cartas-desde-el-bosque"

The concert establishes the Espai Cub as a sound stage/instrument, an echo chamber hosting different screenings and objects to be played by PLOM at the opening but which will remain throughout the exhibition, inviting the public to interact with them if they wish. The result is an installation in which the objects and video game screening play a decisive visual role and the sound output from their use an even stronger one, shaping an objectual sound space.","null","null","","null","null","/en/exposicions/demo"

Like an exile, who lives amid memories and dreams, there are presents in which anamnesis and looking into the future, Proust and Becket, go hand in hand.","null","null","","null","null","/en/exposicions/la-dissid%C3%A8ncia-nost%C3%A0lgica"
