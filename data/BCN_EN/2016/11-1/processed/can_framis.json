Alcaraz experiments with fragile materials imbued with a certain lyricism – water, glass, mirrors and books – to create bonds of tension between them, while constructing a discourse associated with volume, language and time. His output, which transcends limits between disciplines, is a paean to the unfinished work and art as fiction.</p><p><a href='http://www.fundaciovilacasas.com/en/exhibition/jordi-alcaraz' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>","event_start":"01/23/2016","event_end":"06/18/2016","event_category":"Exhibition, Museo Can Framis, Painting, Local art","event_organizer":"Museo Can Framis","event_venue":"Museo Can Framis","event_cost":"5","event_map":1,"event_maplink":1,"event_allday":1,"event_start-time":"","event_end-time":""}]
