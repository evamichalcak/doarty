The mouth is often used to tear, push, move and/or demolish daily objects and architectural surroundings. Distanced from its contemporary civilized usages. A practice that embraces the visceral wherein destruction is a form of creation. For her project with Counter Space, Rochat turns to the political. She questions conditions of contemporary Switzerland; bunkers for all, the world’s biggest tax haven, and a nation performing very well in many measures of well-being. A place faraway from many harsh realities of the world.

Her desire to work on “radical” projects is stronger than ever.</p><p><a href='https://www.facebook.com/events/708954719266007/' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>",02/26/2017,02/27/2017,"Exposición, Espacios alternativos",Counter Space,Counter Space,0,1,1,1,,
