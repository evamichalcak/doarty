    "event_text": "This is an artistic and visual essay concerning the artistic intimacy Francesc Todó (Tortosa, 1922) establishes with the object, with a melancholic gesture moving him to pay homage to the lyricism of music.  Drawings and paintings, nature and machinism compose in “Francesc Todó. Chamber Music” a piece of vibrant colour extolling the everyday via avant-garde figuration.",
