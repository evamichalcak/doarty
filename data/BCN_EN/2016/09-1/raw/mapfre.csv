Like few previous or following artists, Renoir gave shape to the image that depicts our cultural female standards.
Along an exceptional proposal of more than 60 pieces, this exhibition runs in Renoir’s whole career and the different facets of women reflected on his painting: from modern parisian girl of Ball du Moulin de la Galette (1876) to the primitive nymphs of Les baigneuses (1918-1919).
Along the exhibition itinerary, the evolution of the female ideal in Renoir's work is compared to the work of his contemporaries and the new modern generation of painters, with artists such as Vincent Van Gogh, Maurice Denis, Edgar Degas, Pierre Bonnard and Pablo Picasso.
This exhibition has been devised and organised with the scientific collaboration of the Musée d’Orsay and the Musée de l’Orangerie and with exceptional loans from both institutions.
Further information and online booking of tickets (individual and groups) on September 6th.","","null","null","null","null","null","","infoexposbcn@fundacionmapfre.org","mailto:infoexposbcn@fundacionmapfre.org."
