Barcelona. The metropolis in the age of photography, 1860-2004 an exhibition, comprising almost 1,000 works, explores the iconographic photography of the city’s urban development across one and a half centuries of history, through the eyes of Jorge Ribalta, artist, critic and independent curator.
The layout of the show follows the link between urban transformation – marked by the celebration of various major international events, from the 1888 World Fair to the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures – and the historic role of photography in shaping public opinion and the general perception of the city throughout this period. It takes us from the emergence of multiple forms of photography technology in the 1850s to the explosion of digital technologies, the Internet, mobile telephony and social media at the turn of the 21st century.
 
A historical, dominant and down-to-earth journey 
The exhibition presents a journey through 18 galleries lined with works conceived as case studies or specific scenes. These can be divided into six main historical periods: from approval of Cerdà’s plan for the city’s extension, up to the World Fair (1860-1888); gradual emergence of the illustrated press, construction of Via Laietana street, landscaping of Montjuïc and appearance of the discourse of architectural and artistic Modernisme (1888-1929); the 1930s and the Spanish Civil War (1930-1939); predominance of the humanist paradigm and the new photojournalism of the Transition to democracy (1940-1970); arrival of the new topographical documentary style and its link to the city’s recovery and the rise in neighbourhood association movements (1970-1992); and, finally, the new social struggles, where the image took on a new central role in both municipal management and social conflict (1992-2004).
Curator: Jorge Ribalta
