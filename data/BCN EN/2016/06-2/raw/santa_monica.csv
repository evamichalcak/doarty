LOOP Festival 2016 opens its programme with the première of Wonders by Carles Congost (Olot, 1970).
 
Wonders was the proposal winning of the 2nd edition of the Prize of Videocreation promoted by LOOP Barcelona, the Xarxa de Centres d'Arts Visuals de Catalunya and the Arts Santa Mònica. Included in the Festival LOOP Barcelona 2016, Congost will use for the first time in ASM its work Wonders, a video that questions the cultural, social and economic model of the world of the mass culture.
It is a videographic proposal that uses resources next to the musical biopic and the performance to analyze the figure of the ""one-hit wonder"", probably, one of the most symptomatic of the neoliberal paradigm that has impregnated all of the spheres of the global world the last three decades.
The expression ""one-hit wonder"" is, in the record industry, for calling those that have attained the massive recognition in a fleeting way thanks to a successful single. Some of these success are are, until a certain point, ephemeral on purpose, products created for humorous reasons or to use a novelty in the popular culture, however, in the majority of the cases, it implicates serious and enthusiastic musicians who strive to continue its careers when the popularity declines, such it is the case of Dennis Seaton and Michael Grant (members of the group Musical Youth). At the beginning of the decade of the eighty, the formation Musical Youth achieved a strong world repercussion thanks to its first album ""The youth of today"" and, very especially, to the single ""Pass the dutchie"" that sold five million copies to all over the world and opted to a Grammy (the Oscars of the music).
In Wonders, both musicians interpret themselves from a series of script interventions that are inserted with other more personal moments where they explain anecdotes of their own lifes, for example, how they managed to achieve with any of the most important icons of the pop of the period like Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney Donna Summer, Quincy Jones or Michael Jackson. The texts of the script are conceived by both musicians to be read, recited and sung, and start from a specific order to the essayist Eloy Fernández Porta who makes a reflexive and poetic contribution to the phenomenon of the megahit.
In a formal and conceptual level, Wonders connects and becomes related with another recent work, Before the House / An unstable biopic across the Sonido Sabadell (2015) with what shares the contribution of diverse characters who open other perspectives, the fragmented story, the subversion of genres, etc. But in this case the thematic interest focuses much more on the idea about the artist as a product. The ""one-hit wonder"" understood as a complex and paradigmatic figure of our time, the analysis of which can remit us other areas of the society and the culture.","Carles Congost","Wonders","26.05 - 17.07.2016","26.05 - 17.07.2016","http://artssantamonica.gencat.cat/web/sites/santamonica/.content/Imatge/exposicio/2016/Carles_Congost/Wonders1.jpg_356955165.jpg","null","null","null","null","/en/detall/Wonders-00001","null"

New Related Photography has three principle aims. In first regard it is a statement about a new generation, bringing together relevant work by 16 recently-emerging photographers. Almost all the participants, from various countries, were born in the 1970s and 1980s. The selection focuses on photographers working in the contexts ofCatalonia andSpain.
Secondly, this exhibition offers a perspective on modes of photographic expression as developing in the twenty-first century. The most noteworthy characteristic throughout the period has been the rise of group photography, where stories unfold in ways that are narrative, documentary, conceptual and poetical.
Finally, in regards to subject matter, the photographic series presented here contemplate and consider some of the fundamental, defining questions of our time. All told, they constitute a reflection on the human condition, in these nascent years of the new millennium.

The book Permit yourself to drift from what you are reading at this very moment into another situation... Imagine a situation that, in all likelihood, you’ve never been in  is one of the approximately 25 works and deals with the transition or mutation of artists’ books into sculptures, paintings, photographs, installations and even performances. 

Through the work of 14 artists, the exhibition will show how printed matter can reflect and have a spatial and three dimensional quality. For this reason, they must establish specific dialogues between art books (artists’ books, catalogs, editions, etc.) and works of art. In these parallel juxtapositions it will be evident that works of art have become books and vice versa: that books have been transformed into objects. 

Most of the works selected will be exhibited in pairs: books on shelves that can be inspected—and which, in most cases, can also be purchased by visitors—alongside other objects (by Yann Sérandour and Cerith Wyn Evans among others), large-scale installations (by Sandra Gamarra, Francesc Ruiz and Richard Venlet et al.) and performances (Dora Garcia). Through this interplay of correspondences, visitors will be confronted with a variety of links that connect some books to some works of art or sculpture books. The exhibition not only points to the difference between the state of the book and the work of art but also highlights the struggle to close the gap separating the world of books and the world of art. All in all, books and artworks will be presented in a different light that provides a new way to read and analyze books. 

In addition to these pairs, the exhibition will also include historic books that are sculptures in themselves like the famous Magazine Sculpture by British duo Gilbert & George, who in 1970 were the first to make a two-page contribution to Studio International Magazine in the form of sculpture, 1 m 1 step by Dutch artist Stanley Brouwn (1976), which is 100 x 10 cm and can be used as a measuring instrument, and The Cube Book by American artist James Lee Byars (1983), which looks like a solid block of paper. 

The exhibition will be accompanied by a 32-page guide that discusses all the works, designed by Oficina de Disseny (Barcelona).

"","http://artssantamonica.gencat.cat/en/detall/Black-is-Beltza","Arts Santa Mònica presents Black is Beltza, an exhibition project of Fermin Muguruza about a graphic novel of the same name created together with the writer Harkaitz Cano and the illustrator Jorge Alderete. Black is Beltza builds a history of action and espionage which mixes music, love and revolution. The story is told from the viewpoint of Manex Unanue, and talks about the events which marked the convulsive society of the mid-60s.
The exhibition shows material directly or indirectly drawn from the  different stages of the project, i.e. from the photographic archives which have helped the authors structure the story, to the original drawings of the graphic novel or the audiovisual materials narrating the cultural and socio-political panorama of the time.

Black is Beltza includes a public programme of parallel activities to be held in the exhibition space with musical talks, guided visits, conferences and Master Classes in relation to the topics tackled in this project.

Fermin Muguruza is best known for his extensive musical career (Kortatu in the 1980s, Negu Gorriak in the 1990s and subsequently as a solo artist). Over the past eight years he has also done a great deal of work in the audiovisual field. In addition to the films Bass-que Culture, Checkpoint Rock. Canciones desde Palestina, Zuloak and No More Tours, he directed a series of eleven documentaries about Arab music Next Music Station for the Al Jazeera network. He is also currently the music documentary programmer of the festivals DOCSDF in Mexico and Cine Migrante in Argentina.

Harkaitz Cano is one of the most famous exponents of today’s Basque literature. His work covers almost all genres: stories, novels, poetry, essays and more. His work has been translated into English, Dutch, Italian and Russian among other languages. 

Jorge Alderete is a designer and illustrator originally from Patagonia, Argentina and now living in Mexico. His work has been published in a number of anthologies. Always connected with the rock scene, he has designed over 100 albums for bands like Los Fabulosos Cadillacs and Andrés Calamaro (Argentina), among many others.","Fermín Muguruza","Black is Beltza","21.06 - 28.08.2016","21.06 - 28.08.2016","http://artssantamonica.gencat.cat/web/sites/santamonica/.content/Imatge/exposicio/2016/muguruza3.jpg_356955165.jpg","null","null","null","null","/en/detall/Black-is-Beltza","null"
"","http://artssantamonica.gencat.cat/en/detall/Roger-Bernat-00001","Efervescència col·lectiva convida als visitants a interpretar un paper en una peça teatral de manera individual o col·lectiva.
Cada tres setmanes estarà disponible  una peça teatral per ser interpretada. El visitant també podrà consultar documentació sobre les demès peces que es presenten amb el programa.
Consol Llupià, José Begega i Roger Bernat/FFF organitzaran activacions de les peces en diferents moments. 
Les peces teatrals de Roger Bernat inviten a dramatitzar —i a interactuar amb altres espectadors— sota premisses que sovint poden ser incòmodes o políticament comprometedores. Amb Efervescència col·lectiva, Émile Durkheim va descriure la creativitat, a principis del segle XX, com uns moments tempestuosos en els quals una col·lectivitat trenca amb les convencions culturals per tal de reivindicar uns ideals. En el cas de Roger Bernat, però, els escenaris que proposa impliquen encarnar diàlegs i discursos controvertits —fins i tot inconvenients— que no admeten lectures simplistes ni posicionaments fàcils.

Integrant-se a l’estructura que Black Tulip ha desplegat a la planta baixa de l’Arts Santa Mònica, Roger Bernat presenta tres exercicis teatrals que els visitants podran interpretar com a actors i actrius. Els textos d’aquestes tres peces revelen les turbulències que recorren el fenomen col·lectiu i la pròpia experiència dramàtica, ja sigui ocupant-se del món de la parella amb els seus rols estereotipats pel cinema (com a We Need To Talk), del reenactment de les lluites obreres (Numax-Fagor-Plus) o dels desplaçaments del discurs polític i el seu marc escènic (Desplaçament del Palacio de la Moneda).
