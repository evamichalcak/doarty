    "event_text": "«1,000 m2 of desire» proposes raising the visibility of spaces where sexuality moves within the framework of our western culture – real architectural spaces and also imaginary places. The exhibition focuses attention on the way in which these spaces act to configure and typify roles and practices, and highlights the important role that architecture plays as a spring that activates the driving force of desire.",

    "event_text": "This exhibition explores the impact of the philosopher Ramon Llull (1232-1316) on the arts, literature, science and technology. This controversial man, admired and scorned by some of the most enlightened minds in European culture, has acquired a new importance in the current debate on the ways knowledge is shared with others. A topical figure today, he was also one of the leading lights in the intellectual circles of the late 13th century, in which Arab, Jewish and Christian philosophers and scientists alike participated.",
