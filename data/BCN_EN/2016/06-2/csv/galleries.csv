The resources of the artist are the ones from a society full of graphic memories. The image as a concept, without distinguishing procedures or techniques. A hotchpotch where painting, photography, colour, advertising or the texture of the materials are all put together in compositions that teach us how to look to the own and the ominously common.
It is about about the reunion of the apparently opposite. A black and white full of color, humor, a mix between documentary images that fit between fields that shine, tonal and geometric compositions. Fracture and mistake. The threshold between analog and digital, from thousands of images that are stored in the back of the retina, which seems familiar, and that join to form a new experience. Visual fantasy that seek the irony of the new, the experience of the gaze and the narrative at the emerge of the bizarre. A sign to the spectator that is driven to seek the history under the image, just as the artist works in his investigation.</p><p><a href='http://www.artbarcelona.es/en/expositions/technicolor/' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>",05/26/2016,06/28/2016,"Exhibition, Galleries",Victor Lope Arte Contemporáneo,Victor Lope Arte Contemporáneo,0,1,1,1,,

The exhibition gathers his recent photographs and photoengravings as well as 2 videos. On the occasion of the exhibition the gallery has published a poster.
Antoine d`Agata photographs usually show us scenes at the limit, like his own life goes on, a life of discovery and fear confrontation. He is a photographer of the considered taboo topics: narcotized and sexualized realities, personalities that, in their fear or desire, dissolve themselves like the images do.
In this occasion, d`Agata surprises us with some fotocollages that have been created from his own photographs. Thus, each photography captures a large series of images,

a thrilling waterfall of frames that manage to give even more sense of movement of which we usually nd in their work. Some of the show naked bodies, while another one shows the gure of the photographer in a mysterious asking attitude towards the landscape, or another one that shows images of the Aokigahara cursed forest, in Monte Fuji Foothills, there were hundreds of thousands of people committed suicide.
Documentaries Aka Ana (2008) and Atlas (2014) illustrate his experimentations both with the structure and the syntax of the documentary language. Doubtless, D`Agata is searching for a renewal of the perception of the real.
After leaving his home country in 1983, Antoine D ́Agata began a lifestyle that nowadays still maintains. With no xed residence since 2005, he nds in this lifestyle both the freedom and the risk that fertilize his life and work. He has been awarded with many prizes (such as the Prix Niepce in 2001) and he joins the prestigious Magnum Photos agency since 2004. He has published numerous photography books and has exhibited internationally on many occasions. The documentary photography centre Le Bal (Paris) dedicated him the exhibition Anticorps in 2015.
Last but not least, the gallery is happy to announce on Friday May 20th (the day after the opening) there will be a screening of Aka Ana and Atlas followed by a converstion between Antoine d`Agata and Alberto Garcia-Alix, moderated by Nicolás Combarro. This activity is part of the DOC eld festival panel and will start at 5pm.

During the months of the exhibition, there will be a screening of the two videos every Friday at 6pm.</p><p><a href='http://www.artbarcelona.es/en/expositions/paradigms/' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>",05/19/2016,07/31/2016,"Exhibition, Galleries",Galeria Carles Taché Projects,Galeria Carles Taché Projects,0,1,1,1,,

The exhibition questions the duality between the claim of desire for anonymity and the dissemination of privacy through new technologies. The massive amount of content being shared causes a trivialization of the images shown and transforming our information into objects of fast and ephemeral consumption.
The video work presented is a performance action that reflects the enigmatic nature of the paper artwork that is shown. This new exhibition continues on the same vein as “Ejercicios de Ruptura”, previous exhibition of Johan Barrios in the gallery in the framework of Art Nou, where the artist had already talked about the idea of capturing the ephemeral nature of a performative image into an artwork.</p><p><a href='http://www.artbarcelona.es/en/expositions/the-happening-of-an-idea/' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>",05/27/2016,06/18/2016,"Exhibition, Galleries",Victor Lope Arte Contemporáneo,Victor Lope Arte Contemporáneo,0,1,1,1,,

Arikha, F. Auerbach, R.B. Kitaj i Euan Uglow' />The exhibition brings together more than twenty works of four prominent figurative painters of the same generation that bear a strong expressive power: Avigdor Arikha (Rădăuţi, Romania, 1929-2010), Frank Auerbach (Berlin, Germany, 1931), R.B. Kitaj (Cleveland, Ohio, 1932-2007) and Euan Uglow (London, Great Britain, 1932-2000). Looking at reality from different angles, they reveal how fertile imagery can be and that, despite the dominance of abstraction in the twentieth century, there is still space for figuration, which salvages great potential.
Avigdor Arikha, of Jewish descent, could escape from a Nazi concentration camp in his childhood. He fought in the War of Independence in Israel before he settled in Paris, where he carried out his career until his death. Arikha masters the use of colours and the appearance of natural light in his works and captures moments of daily life. Small-sized works show views of Paris, interiors and still lifes, as well as his wife, relatives, friends and nudes.
Frank Auerbach moved to the United Kingdom at the age of eight, escaping from Nazism. Since then he lives and works in London. Auerbach destroys the works that he doesn’t like at the end of each day. He scratches strokes of the brush off the canvas and overlays them again, creating thick layers. His vibrating work of an expressionistic appearance often shows the streets of London or portraits of friends and family.
R. B. Kitaj, also Jewish, studied in New York and Vienna. He served in the United States Army before he lived in London for forty years. After the death of his wife in 1997, he moved to Los Angeles where he died ten years later. His Jewish identity is very present in his work, as well as pictorial references to Degas, Cézanne and the post-impressionists. Symptomatic for his work is the use of bright colours.
Euan Uglow has lived all his life in London but constantly travelled all around the world. His early works show a blurry stroke of brush and gloomy, earthy colours. Later his painting became more precisely. He started using brighter colours, which remind of the pictorial chromatology of the Italian Quattrocento. Characteristic for his work is a meticulous and precise geometry, which decelerates the completion of his paintings. Recurrent topics in his work are still lifes and nudes that hide their faces and bend themselves in various positions.</p><p><a href='http://www.artbarcelona.es/en/expositions/a-arikha-f-auerbach-r-b-kitaj-i-euan-uglow/' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>",05/11/2016,06/23/2016,"Exhibition, Galleries",Galeria Marlborough,Galeria Marlborough,0,1,1,1,,

http://www.artbarcelona.es/en/expositions/miserachs/,Xavier Miserachs - Miserachs,"<p><img src='http://www.artbarcelona.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AXM-P35-808x6401.jpg' width='228' height='182' alt='Xavier Miserachs - Miserachs' />Ana Mas Projects, based in Barcelona, is pleased to present a selection of more than 70 images (original and reproductions) of one of the most famous Spanish photographers of the XX century, Xavier Miserachs (Barcelona, 1937). An outstanding representative of the young and non-conformist generation of the 1950’s/60’s that decided to distance themselves from conventional and academic photography to reclaim a new visual identity. The theorist Josep Maria Casademont labelled this new generation of photographers the New Avant-garde and all of them gathered under the name of Agrupació Fotográfica de Cataluña (AFC) bringing forward to the public a new and very subjective reality. Professionals like Francesc Català-Roca, Oriol Maspons, Leopoldo Pomés and Ramon Massats were part of the AFC, and Miserachs was the youngest member(1) of the group.

Miserachs’s youth coincided with major cultural and historical changes in Spain. Indeed Spain was freeing its chains from the franquist autarchy, the economy was changing and frontiers were opening up to a new outside world. With the end of World War II were born new modes of expression, things were

changing fast and it wasn’t any longer about “thinking about what you could one day say, and instead simply speaking in the most efficient way out of pure necessity.”(2).Consequently, photography took under new responsibilities and with that came a new social and humanistic interest for it. It was a key moment for photography, indeed it was when the idea of modern photojournalism as we know it was consolidated(3), and Miserachs found his inspiration from the more prominent photographers of his time, such as Català-Roca, Robert Frank(4) and especially from William Klein. Xavier Miserachs also had the opportunity to attend The Family of Man, one of the most important photographic exhibitions of his time and a turning point in the art world and for Miserachs himself(5). The Family of Man, presented at The MoMA in 1955; and curated by Edward Steichen strengthened and reaffirmed the new vision and purpose of photography; to tell and narrate a story.

In this sense, Xavier Miserachs can be considered a paradigm of his generation, he not only had an extraordinary passion for the photographic art,but also wanted to make a living out of it. This is how he got the amazing opportunity to make his passion for the medium become his work as a correspondent for well known media such as La Vanguardia, Gaceta Ilustrada, Intervíu and Triunfo. At the same time, Miserachs started to participate in numerous group shows with other photographers like Ricard Terré or Ramon Massats(6) and started to work on publications such as Barcelona Blanco y Negro (1964) if we had to name just one. This publication is extremely important in Miserachs’s career, considering the fact that he was still a young man at the time of publication, Barcelona Blanco y Negro represents the acknowledgment of Barcelona as a city by its own citizens (7), and Costa Brava Show (1966). He illustrated several books, worked as a producer and director of photography in two films by Enric Vila Matas and Emma Cohen and even worked as a producer and director for a short film called Amen. He also cofounded and was one of the first photography teacher of the Eina School. In 1961, the year of his death, he was given a recognition of his life work as a photographer, the Cross of Sant Jordi, awarded by the Generalitat of Catalunya.

In this occasion, Ana Mas Projects, thanks to the generous collaboration of Xavier Miserachs family is pleased to present a wide selection of works from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. All, are emblematic of Miserach’s work in Barcelona. The selection includes some of his most iconic published pictures but also a more intimate body of work that brings to a new light his extraordinary ability to capture emotions and personal moments. The exhibition will be divided into different thematic: locations of Barcelona, its streets, bars and cabarets, the Costa Brava (pictures of Costa Brava Show, 1966), and rural scenes of Andalucía. Also, a more abstract group of pictures will show nature, landscapes and daily objects, fruits of Miserach’s first approximations with photography.

1 Miserachs joined the AFC in 1950 and with just 17 years old won the Luis Navarro award for the 2nd national salon of modern photography awarded by the same AFC.

5 After 5 years of studying Medicine, Miserachs decided to drop out Medicine and dedicate himself to photography. “Xavier was born for the second time as a photographer when he saw the The Family of Man” exhibition. He was so impressed that he decided to change his career. (Oriol Maspons, 1998)

http://www.artbarcelona.es/en/expositions/se-vende-plaza-de-parking/,Martí Anson - Se vende plaza de parking,"<p><img src='http://www.artbarcelona.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/marti-anson-se-vende-plaza-de-parking.jpg' width='228' height='182' alt='Martí Anson - Se vende plaza de parking' />Galeria Estrany–de la Mota is pleased to present the first solo exhibition of Martí Anson. The project Se vende plaza de parking [parking for sale] starts from a research on urban growth and how this has gradually led to a diminishing of developable land in urban areas. Through a site-specific installation that ironically modifies the architecture and typical uses of the exhibition space of the gallery, the artist reflects on the transformation and reuse of dead architectural spaces for other temporary activities. According to recent studies, 79,20% of the territory of Barcelona is urbanized. The forecast is that developable territory of the city will be exhausted between 2018 and 2021 if we keep up with the same rhythm of construction. Facing this phenomenon, some architects advocate for alternative constructive models focused on the reformulation of existing spaces, especially those considered dead. An example of such practices is to harness urban spaces as roofs for building gardens or green areas. Another example is how somehow unconsciously we have been using private garages of single-family homes for other activities such as storage or DIY. These spaces, as spaces dedicated to housing, but which by nature are far enough away from it, have also been the ideal places for amateur rehearsal studios or the first office location of what later on have become large companies, as is the case of the former garage of Palo Alto (California) where the company Hewlett-Packard was founded in 1939. Over time this phenomenon of vehicle’s storage space reuse has also affected the parking spaces of big shopping malls. In the United States, for example, it is common the usage of these spaces for other activities, such as places where to learn to drive or spontaneous as barbecue gatherings. This framework is the starting point for Marti Anson’s project Se vende plaza de parking, where he continues his investigation on the modification of architectural spaces to create a state of uncertainty. The artist raises expectations which later on always become frustrated, because in reality, its only purpose is to generate those expectations. He creates paradoxical situations in which apparently not much goes on, thus creating spaces that remain in suspension. The installation is formally a pop replica of a garage, in which the artist reproduces in the exhibition space the different elements that without being necessarily aware we have internalized and allow us to identify such spaces. The white grid as an element of organization that defines the space that can occupy each of the cars, the grey floor that continues on the walls with a one meter to protect the wall surface of the accidental blows, the maroon strip of about fifteen centimetres working a visual reference to calculate distances with adjacent walls at the time of parking or the presence of a vehicle in the gallery space. Copying these architectural elements and moving them from one place to another creates in the viewer a situation of strangeness, makes unknown the ordinary, that to which we are accustomed. A resource that the artist has already used previously on other projects like Martí i la fàbrica de farina [Martí & the flour factory] (2009). As posed by architects and town planners to tackle the phenomenon of lack of developable space, the artist recovers unused gallery space (entrance hall) to give a new function. While it becomes something else, it stops being a place of contemplation; the spatial changes intensify its uselessness, turning it into a space to reflect on the meaning of art and its purpose. Anson generates states of suspension in which apparently nothing happens, but the small details allow open reflection on other issues such as work (Fizcarraldo, 2005), heritage (Martí i la fàbrica de farina, 2009) or cooperativism (Pavelló Català. Arquitecte anònim [Catalan Pavilion. Anonymous architect], 2013-2015). Se vende plaza de parking recovers the discursive condition of all his work and the tension that this establishes with contemporaneity. He talks about the paradox of art, the result is a great effort by a creator who often does not have a particular effect, is a work that is often only understandable by itself and emphasizes the lack of usefulness of art.</p><p><a href='http://www.artbarcelona.es/en/expositions/se-vende-plaza-de-parking/' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>",04/15/2016,06/17/2016,"Exhibition, Galleries",Galeria Estrany – de la Mota,Galeria Estrany – de la Mota,0,1,1,1,,

Contextualized in his beginnings in the framework of the new American expressionists, his attitude towards art and painting materialized in an aporia induced a romantic fascination with the unlimited and a strange desire to dematerialize painting into ""pure visuality"".
The works of Hollingsworth bring up some basic questions of abstract art as the absolute power of art, the emancipation of conventions and spiritual revolution to express what remains hidden from the senses.
In the words of the art critic Juan Bufill, ""Dennis Hollingsworth's work is an excellent and clear example of painting in XXI century, which is a consequence of but different from the previous painting. It is abstract but meawhile very physical and concrete. Its certain aspects enable to define it as materialistic, or structuralist, because it owns an underlined plastic syntax where unfold and relate a particular repertoire of formal elements and materials of technical procedures. But at the same time his paintings do not conform to deploy exercises of structuralist style and tends to evoke and suggest existential life experiences. ¨
The introspection of the techniques for creation leads the artist to new ways of conceiving the creative act. This new direction that maintains the essence of his work is characterized by the importance of drawings as well as introducing new elements such as asterisks, naturalist reason that reminds us of something hidden behind, and that brings us an aura of mediterraneidad.
In his paintings, multicolored whirl of his palette can be seen, which becomes almost Fauvist combined with the psychoanalysis of creation, resulting in a work full of symbolism and emotion, in which it´s intuited the freedom and the containment, the free will and the pure mathematics, the original chaos and the confusion of the most harmonious fantasy.
In its aesthetics Theodor Adorno said that ""the works of art are more than existence, but not because of something that existent, but its language"" (Aesthetic Theory, Taurus, 1992). Besides that the work of Hollingsworth witness a reconceptualization of the ways to understand and make art, it is full of reminiscences of the tradition of the avant-garde and in them it can be perceived the influence of Joan Miró, André Breton or Jason Pollock among others. Dematerialization of the paintings, result of the conceptual aesthetics of the 50s, leads to a purely visual aesthetic, in which the oil becomes the main axis of the frame and the creative breath of the painter gives rise to works that focus the various forces of nature.
The whole selected works for this exhibition are full of Mediterranean symbolism expressed by the asterisks that represent the multiple paths of ships, as well as the preponderant hidden forces of sea at sunset with an orange tone that bodes night. An oasis of peace that is presented hidden from our senses.
Hollingsworth´s works are part of the collection of MoCA Museum of Contemporary Art (Los Angeles, U.S.) and the MMAP Pérez Art Museum of Miami (Miami, U.S. ).</p><p><a href='http://www.artbarcelona.es/en/expositions/asteriscos-rotos/' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>",06/09/2016,07/29/2016,"Exhibition, Galleries",Galeria Miguel Marcos,Galeria Miguel Marcos,0,1,1,1,,

These engravings contain demons, chimeras, fish flying through the sky and death itself, variously with a scythe or in the mask of a plague doctor.
Mundus – the Latin ""world"" and Inverso – is both an Italian ""reverse, the opposite"" and the Old Italian ""poetry,"" which alludes to the art processing. In AES+F’s interpretation, the absurdist scenes from the medieval carnival appear as episodes of contemporary life in a multichannel video installation.
Characters act out scenes of absurd social utopias and exchange masks, morphing from beggars to rich men, from policemen to thieves. Metrosexual street-cleaners are showering the city with refuse. Female inquisitors torture men on IKEA-style structures. Children and seniors are fighting in a kickboxing match. Inverso Mundus is a world where chimeras are pets and the Apocalypse is entertainment.
*“Inverso Mundus” was created with the generous support of Blavatnik Family Foundation (USA) and Faena Art Foundation (Argentina), and with kind assistance from Fortuny (Italy-USA), PhotoFactory (Russia) and Triumph Gallery (Russia)</p><p><a href='http://www.artbarcelona.es/en/expositions/inverso-mundus/' target='_blank'>+info</a></p>",05/27/2016,07/02/2016,"Exhibition, Galleries",Galeria Senda,Galeria Senda,0,1,1,1,,
