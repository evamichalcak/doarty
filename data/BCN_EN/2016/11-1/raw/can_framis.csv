				 - JORDI ALCARAZ",Monday 23 | January - Sunday 18 | June,"Jordi Alcaraz (Calella, 1963) is a creator at the intersection between visual poetry and conceptual projection, whose work consists of a metaphorical approach to the object. Alcaraz experiments with fragile materials imbued with a certain lyricism – water, glass, mirrors and books – to create bonds of tension between them, while constructing a discourse associated with volume, language and time. His output, which transcends limits between disciplines, is a paean to the unfinished work and art as fiction.",https://gestio.fundaciovilacasas.com/contactes//upfiles/exposicions/imatges/th_th_A12264194.jpg,Monday 23 | January - Sunday 18 | June,null,null,null,null,null,"Jordi Alcaraz
