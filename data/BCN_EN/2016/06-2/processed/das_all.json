as that point where it is not possible to </font><font>distinguish reality from imagination, that moment can change our lives and that we are not able to explain because it is beyond reason and understanding, images where we find feelings of desire, eroticism and sensuality with restraint and very subtle. </font><font>The series comes from wanting to </font><font>express these feelings and emotions that make us human, we return to the </font><font>origin of a relaxed, carefree manner, making it </font><font>almost a game. </font><font>But also with traps, hazards; </font><font>the forbidden inspiring, evoking all that makes us mistake and learn from life, our bodies and ourselves. </font><font>Recurring items are repeated in the </font><font>form of obsession, it entered a dark world but beauty and sensuality. </font><font>These paintings are based on photographs taken in intimate moment with mixed feelings at different times and people who, by chance (or magic), together in one time and place. </font><font>Sometimes the eroticism that may suggest the image hides a whisper that mixes confusion, love and stark reality, like a frozen instant in the life of anyone who can change forever. </font><font>Sponsor Moritz Vitacoco // 100% Naturelle\n\n </font></font><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1064991530247358/\" target=\"_blank\"><font><font>+
