Throughout his life, he has renounced to many exhibitions and honours. I want to manifest, once again, my compromise with the man and his body of work”.
Carles Taché
Next Thursday June 30th, Galeria Carles Taché will be pleased to open the exhibition CAMPANO 2003-2009, a solo show by artist Miguel Ángel Campano (Madrid, 1948), which will be held until mid September (with the interruption of august, when the gallery will remain closed to the public).
Deeply heterogeneous painter, Campano shies away from any school or pre-stablished method. He maintains, since the eighties, a career far from being linear and closer to a non-style practice. Since that moment, Campano seemed to have become one of the great renovators of the Spanish painting in late XXth century.
Di erent to the last exhibition dedicated to Campano at the gallery, in which one could trace an heterogeneous path throughout di erent decades of his career, this show now gathers a series of large scale paintings made during the 2003-2009 septennium. They are all abstract paintings, full of nuances and modulations that allows us to see that
one again that Campano is, above all, a painter who Works in response to the internal consistency of painting, to the very essence of painting.
Relevance of Miguel Ángel Campano within the Spanish contemporary art scene was recognized in 1996 when he was awarded with the National Fine Arts Award. His big retrospective solo show at the Palacio Velázquez (Madrid) in 1999 confirmed it.",null,null,null,http://www.artbarcelona.es/en/expositions/campano-2003-2009/
